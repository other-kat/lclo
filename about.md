<h3>
	<p>THE LONDON COMMUNITY LAPTOP ORCHESTRA IS A COMMUNITY RUN LAPTOP ORCHESTRA MAKING SOUNDS IN A VARIETY OF UNUSUAL PLACES. THE LCLO HOLDS A COMMUNITY ETHOS WHERE <mark>ANYONE</mark> CAN PARTICIPATE.</p>
	<p>INSPIRED BY GROUPS LIKE THE 1969-1974'S <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_Orchestra">SCRATCH ORCHESTRA</a> AND WITH A FOCUS ON GUERRILLA PERFORMANCES, WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF THE LAPTOP AS A TOOL FOR LOCALISED COLLECTIVE CREATIVE ENGAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE.</p>
	<p>OUR POLITICS ARE EXPLICIT BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE. SOUND ART SPACES CAN BE ISOLATING, ELITIST, EXCLUSIONARY AND BIGOTED. WE AIM TO BE ACTIVE IN BREAKING THOSE STEREOTYPES.</p>
	<p>FOUNDED AND (CURRENTLY) RUN BY <a href="https://otherkat.com/">KAT MACDONALD.</a></p>
